Multiple linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two or more explanatory variables and a response 
variable by fitting a linear equation to observed data. 
Every value of the independent variable x is associated with a value of the dependent variable y. 

Example:
Create a model based off of this sample that will allow to assess where and which companies we can invest to achieve 
the goal of maximazing profit.
Eq:                          y = b0+b1X1+b2X2+b3X3+….+bnXn
we can also represent it as: y = b0X0+b1X1+b2X2+b3X3+….+bnXn where X0 = 1

We will work with the Backward Elimination:
-Select significance level
-Fit our model with all possible independent variables.
-Consider variable with highest p-value.
-If p-value is greater than significance level, remove variable
-Again fit the model without removed variable.

here, significance level and p-value are statistical terms. 
Just remember these terms for now as we do not want to go in details. 
Just note that our python libraries will provide us these values for our independent variables.
