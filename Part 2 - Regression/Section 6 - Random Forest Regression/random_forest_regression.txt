Forest is a supervised learning algorithm. 
Like you can already see from it’s name, it creates a forest and makes it somehow random. 
The „forest“ it builds, is an ensemble of Decision Trees, most of the time trained with the “bagging” method. 
The general idea of the bagging method is that a combination of learning models increases the overall result.

=>Random forest builds multiple decision trees and merges them together to get a more
