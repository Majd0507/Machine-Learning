Data preprocessing is a data mining technique that involves transforming raw data into an understandable format. 
Real-world data is often incomplete, inconsistent, and/or lacking in certain behaviors or trends, and is likely 
to contain many errors. Data preprocessing is a proven method of resolving such issues. 
Data preprocessing prepares raw data for further processing.

Labraries:
Numpy : contains mathematical tools.
Matplotlib.pyplot : plot nice charts.
Pandas : import and manage data sets.

The sklearn.preprocessing package provides several common utility functions and transformer classes to change raw 
feature vectors into a representation that is more suitable for the downstream estimators.

In general, learning algorithms benefit from standardization of the data set. 
If some outliers are present in the set, robust scalers or transformers are more appropriate. 
The behaviors of the different scalers, transformers, and normalizers on a dataset containing marginal outliers is 
highlighted in Compare the effect of different scalers on data with outliers.
