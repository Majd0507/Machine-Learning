Simple linear regression is a statistical method that allows us to summarize and study relationships between two continuous 
(quantitative) variables:
-One variable, denoted x, is regarded as the predictor, explanatory, or independent variable.
-The other variable, denoted y, is regarded as the response, outcome, or dependent variable.

Example:
Create a linear model from 1/3 of the Data and compare the rest with the predection of the results.
Eq: (dependent VAR=salary) Y = (constant=starting salary) S0 + (coefficient) S1 * (independent VAR=experience) X 
Steps:
1-Data preprocessing.
2-Train the model with Data.
3-Predict the test results.
4-Visualising the training set and the test that results on graphs with 'matplotlib.pyplot'.
