Polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable x 
and the dependent variable y is modelled as an nth degree polynomial in x. 
Polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship between the value of x and the corresponding conditional mean of y, 
denoted E(y |x), and has been used to describe nonlinear phenomena such as the growth rate of tissues, the distribution 
of carbon isotopes in lake sediments, and the progression of disease epidemics.
Although polynomial regression fits a nonlinear model to the data, as a statistical estimation problem it is linear, 
in the sense that the regression function E(y | x) is linear in the unknown parameters that are estimated from the data. 
For this reason, polynomial regression is considered to be a special case of multiple linear regression.

We are like a human ressource team working for a big company and we are about to hire a new employee in this company.
So this new employee seems to be great a goood fit for the joband we are about to make an offer to this potential new 
emloyee.
We will build a bluffing detector using polynomial regression and predict the salary based on the different levels.
