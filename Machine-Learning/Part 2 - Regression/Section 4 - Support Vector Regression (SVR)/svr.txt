SVR performs linear regression in a higher (dimensional space).
SVR, which stands for Support Vector Regressor, is a regressor. 
Regressors perform regression, predicting continuous ordered variables. 

Steps:
1-Collect a training set t={X,Y} ; X and Y are vectors.
2-Choose a kernel and it's parameters as well as any regularization needed.
3-Form the correlation matrix , K ; K is a vector.
4-Train your machine ,exactly or approximately, to get contraction coefficients Q = {Qi} ; Q is a vector.
5-Use these coefficients, create your estimator f(X,Q,x*)=y* .
