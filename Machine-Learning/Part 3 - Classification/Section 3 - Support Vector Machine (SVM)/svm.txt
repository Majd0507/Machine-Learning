A support vector machine is a supervised learning algorithm that sorts data into two categories. 
It is trained with a series of data already classified into two categories, building the model as it is initially trained. 
The task of an SVM algorithm is to determine which category a new data point belongs in. 
This makes SVM a kind of non-binary linear classifier.
An SVM algorithm should not only place objects into categories, but have the margins between them on a graph as wide as 
possible.

Some applications of SVM include:
-Text and hypertext classification
-Image classification
-Recognizing handwritten characters
-Biological sciences, including protein classification
