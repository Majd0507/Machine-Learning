A kernel is a similarity function. It is a function that you, as the domain expert, provide to a machine learning 
algorithm. It takes two inputs and spits out how similar they are. 
Suppose your task is to learn to classify images. You have (image, label) pairs as training data. Consider the typical 
machine learning pipeline: you take your images, you compute features, you string the features for each image into a 
vector, and you feed these "feature vectors" and labels into a learning algorithm.

Data --> Features --> Learning algorithm

Kernels offer an alternative. Instead of defining a slew of features, you define a single kernel function to compute 
similarity between images. You provide this kernel, together with the images and labels to the learning algorithm, and 
out comes a classifier.

=>increase the dimensionality of the space to make linear separable dataset.
#mapping to a higher dimensional space can be highly compute-intensive (computation and precessing power).
