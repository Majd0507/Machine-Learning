Apriori Algorithm
The Apriori algorithm principle says that if an itemset is frequent, then all of its subsets are frequent.this means that 
if {0,1} is frequent, then {0} and {1} have to be frequent.

The rule turned around says that if an itemset is infrequent, then its supersets are also infrequent.

We first need to find the frequent itemsets, and then we can find association rules.

Pros: Easy to code up

Cons: May be slow on large datasets

Works with: Numeric values, nominal values
