The Eclat algorithm is used to perform itemset mining. Itemset mining let us find frequent patterns in data like if a 
consumer buys milk, he also buys bread. 
This type of pattern is called association rules and is used in many application domains.

The basic idea for the eclat algorithm is use tidset intersections to compute the support of a candidate itemset avoiding 
the generation of subsets that does not exist in the prefix tree.

Algorithm:
The Eclat algorithm is defined recursively. The initial call use all the single items with their tidsets. 
In each recursive call, the function IntersectTidsets verifies each itemset-tidset 
pair \left\langle {X,t(X)} \right\rangle with all the others pairs \left\langle {Y,t(Y)} \right\rangle to generate 
new candidates N_{XY}. If the new candidate is frequent, it is added to the set P_{X}. 
Then, recursively, it finds all the frequent itemsets in the X branch. The algorithm searchs in a DFS manner to find all 
the frequent sets.
