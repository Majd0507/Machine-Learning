After we built our Machine Learning models, some questions remained unanswered:
-How to deal with the bias variance tradeoff when building a model and evaluating its performance ?
-How to choose the optimal values for the hyperparameters (the parameters that are not learned) ?
-How to find the most appropriate Machine Learning model for my business problem ?
By:
-k-Fold Cross Validation
-Grid Search
Eventually we will finish this course by a last bonus section included in this part, dedicated to one of the most powerful 
Machine Learning model, that has become more and more popular: "XGBoost".
