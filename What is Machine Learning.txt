“Machine Learning is the science of getting computers to learn and act like humans do, and improve their learning over 
time in autonomous fashion, by feeding them data and information in the form of observations and real-world interactions.”

1-Unsupervised ML: when the data set is unlabeled (no feature or class/ category labels to be predicted). The algorithms 
used are clustering algorithms, such as KMEAN, Hierarchical, DBSCAN, etc. These algorithms partition the data set into 
similar groups/clusters, such as market segmentats.

2-Supervised ML: when the data set is labeled (has a label feature to be predicted). There are two types of algorithms:
-Regression algorithms for prediction of non integer numeric features (e.g. temperature, sales, etc.), using Regression 
algorithms
-Classification for the prediction of a label/class (medical tests: e.g. malignant, not malignant; weather forecast: sunny,
 cloudy, rainy, hot, cold, etc.). The main classification algorithms are: K-Nearest Neighbors: KNN, Logistic Regression, 
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Descion Trees, Bayesian Algorithm, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and other ANN-based 
algorithms such as Deep Learning.

3-Reinforcement learning:  The Reinforcement learning is branch of AI and its type of machine learning. In case of 
Reinforcement learning machine and agents automatically determines ideal behaviour within a defined context. For it a task 
is given to the agent and there are two options, agent chooses any one of them and if the choice is correct it will be 
rewarded otherwise it will be punished. Based on these reward and punishment agent learns the ideal behaviour.
