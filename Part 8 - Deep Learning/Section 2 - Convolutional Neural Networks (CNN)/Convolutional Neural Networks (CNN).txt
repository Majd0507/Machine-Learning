In machine learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of deep, feed-forward artificial neural 
networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery.

CNNs use a variation of multilayer perceptrons designed to require minimal preprocessing.They are also known as shift 
invariant or space invariant artificial neural networks (SIANN), based on their shared-weights architecture and translation 
invariance characteristics.

Convolutional networks were inspired by biological processes in that the connectivity pattern between neurons resembles 
the organization of the animal visual cortex. Individual cortical neurons respond to stimuli only in a restricted region 
of the visual field known as the receptive field. The receptive fields of different neurons partially overlap such that 
they cover the entire visual field.

CNNs use relatively little pre-processing compared to other image classification algorithms. This means that the network 
learns the filters that in traditional algorithms were hand-engineered. This independence from prior knowledge and human 
effort in feature design is a major advantage.

They have applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems and natural language processing.

In this example, we are simply going to solve an image classification problem where our goal will be to classify some 
images and tell for each image the class of the image.
We will have some images of cats and dogs and we will train a CNN to predict if the image is a photo of a dog or a cat.
