The Upper-Confidence-Bound method (UCB) which attempts to explore the action space based on the uncertainty or variance 
value. 
In this approach, the algorithm is forced to search based on taking some random action. It doesn't take any expectations 
into account or try to find values which are more likely to be rewarding; UCB fills this void.
