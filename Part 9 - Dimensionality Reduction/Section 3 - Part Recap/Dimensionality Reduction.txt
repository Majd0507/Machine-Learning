There are two types of Dimensionality Reduction techniques:
-Feature Selection
-Feature Extraction


Feature Selection techniques are Backward Elimination, Forward Selection, Bidirectional Elimination, Score Comparison 
and more. We covered these techniques in Part 2 - Regression.

In this part we will cover the following Feature Extraction techniques:
-Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
-Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
-Kernel PCA
