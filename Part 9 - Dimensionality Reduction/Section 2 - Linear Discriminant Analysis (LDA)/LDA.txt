Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is most commonly used as dimensionality reduction technique in the pre-processing step 
for pattern-classification and machine learning applications. The goal is to project a dataset onto a lower-dimensional 
space with good class-separability in order avoid overfitting and also reduce computational costs.
The goal of LDA is to project a feature space (a dataset n-dimensional samples) onto a small subspace K (where K=<n-1)
while maintaining the class-discriminatory information.

Principal Component Analysis vs. Linear Discriminant Analysis:
LDA differs because in addition to finding the component axises with LDA we are interested in the axes that maximize the 
separation between multiple classes.
Both PCA and LDA are linear tranformation techniques used for dimensional reduction. PCA is described as unsupervised but
LDA is supervised because of the relation of the dependent variable.
