PCA considered to be one of the most used unsupervised algorithms and can be seen as the most popular dimensionality
reduction algorithm.
PCA is used for operations such:
-Noise filtering
-Visualization
-Feature Extraction
-Stock market predections
-Gene data analysis
The goal of PCA is to:
-Identify patterns in data
-Detect the correlation between variables
=>Reduce the dimensions of a d-dimensional dataset by projecting it onto a (k)-dimensional subspace (where K<d)
Principal component analysis:
-Standardize the data 
-Obtain the Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues from covariance matrix or correlation matrix, or perform Singular Vector 
 Decomposition.
-Sort eigenvalues in descending order and choose the K eigenvectors that correspond to the K largest eigenvalues where K 
 is the number of dimensions of the new feature subspace (K<=d).
-Construct the projection matrix W from the selected K eigenvectors.
-Transform the original dataset X via W to obtain a k-dimensional feature subspace Y
=>Learn about the relationship between X and Y values by finding a list of principal axes
