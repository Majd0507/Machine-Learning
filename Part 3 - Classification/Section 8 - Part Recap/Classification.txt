Classification: This is a type of problem where we predict the categorical response value where the data can be separated 
into specific “classes” (ex: we predict one of the values in a set of values).

Some examples are :
-this mail is spam or not?
-will it rain today or not?
-is this picture a cat or not?

Basically ‘Yes/No’ type questions called binary classification.

Other examples are :
-this mail is spam or important or promotion?
-is this picture a cat or a dog or a tiger?

This type is called multi-class classification.
