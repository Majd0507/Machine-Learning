Logistic regression is a statistical method for analysing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables 
that determine an outcome. 
The outcome is measured with a dichotomous variable. 
It is used to predict a binary outcome (1 / 0, Yes / No, True / False) given a set of independent variables. 
To represent binary / categorical outcome, we use dummy variables. You can also think of logistic regression as a special 
case of linear regression when the outcome variable is categorical, where we are using log of odds as dependent variable. 
In simple words, it predicts the probability of occurrence of an event by fitting data to a logit function.
the logistic regression is a predictive analysis. Logistic regression is used to describe data and to explain the 
relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level 
independent variables.
We gone create a model for a car company that predict which users gone buy an SUV depending on their age and salary.
