Naive Bayes classifier calculates the probabilities for every factor. 
Then it selects the outcome with highest probability.

This classifier assumes the features are independent. Hence the word naive. 
Even with this it is powerful algorithm used for:
-Real time Prediction: Naive Bayes is an eager learning classifier and it is sure fast. Thus, it could be used for making 
		       predictions in real time.
-Multi class Prediction: This algorithm is also well known for multi class prediction feature. Here we can predict the 
		         probability of multiple classes of target variable.
-Text classification/ Spam Filtering/ Sentiment Analysis: Naive Bayes classifiers mostly used in text classification 
                                                          (due to better result in multi class problems and independence 
                                                          rule) have higher success rate as compared to other algorithms. 
                                                          As a result, it is widely used in Spam filtering (identify spam 
							  e-mail) and Sentiment Analysis (in social media analysis, 
							  to identify positive and negative customer sentiments)
-Recommendation System: Naive Bayes Classifier and Collaborative Filtering together builds a Recommendation System that 
                        uses machine learning and data mining techniques to filter unseen information and predict whether 
			a user would like a given resource or not
