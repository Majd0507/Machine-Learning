A decision tree is a tree where each node represents a feature(attribute), each link(branch) represents a decision(rule) 
and each leaf represents an outcome(categorical or continues value).

CART (Classification and Regression Trees) -> uses Gini Index(Classification) as metric.
ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) -> uses Entropy function and Information gain as metrics.

Decision tress often mimic the human level thinking so its so simple to understand the data and make some good 
interpretations.
Decision trees actually make you see the logic for the data to interpret(not like black box algorithms like SVM,NN,etc..)
