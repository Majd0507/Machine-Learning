Random Forest is a flexible, easy to use machine learning algorithm that produces, even without hyper-parameter tuning, 
a great result most of the time. It is also one of the most used algorithms, because it’s simplicity and the fact that it 
can be used for both classification and regression tasks. 

It works in four steps:
-Select random samples from a given dataset.
-Construct a decision tree for each sample and get a prediction result from each decision tree.
-Perform a vote for each predicted result.
-Select the prediction result with the most votes as the final prediction.

Advantages:
-Random forests is considered as a highly accurate and robust method because of the number of decision trees participating 
in the process.
-It does not suffer from the overfitting problem. The main reason is that it takes the average of all the predictions, 
which cancels out the biases.
-The algorithm can be used in both classification and regression problems.
-Random forests can also handle missing values. There are two ways to handle these: using median values to replace 
continuous variables, and computing the proximity-weighted average of missing values.
-You can get the relative feature importance, which helps in selecting the most contributing features for the classifier.

Disadvantages:
-Random forests is slow in generating predictions because it has multiple decision trees. Whenever it makes a prediction, 
all the trees in the forest have to make a prediction for the same given input and then perform voting on it. 
This whole process is time-consuming.
-The model is difficult to interpret compared to a decision tree, where you can easily make a decision by following the 
path in the tree.
